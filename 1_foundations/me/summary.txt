My name is Tyler Kim. I graduated from UVA as a Rodman Scholar with a BS in Computer Science and I am currently a graduate student at UT Austin's MSAI program studying AI. I work for the government and actively working on a research project with a professor from UVA where we use generative AI models to correct for systematic bias in particle accelerators.
When time permits, I enjoy playing video games, exercising, and learning new things in my free time. Additionally, I like to work on projects in my spare time. My current project is using an LLM model to serve as a digital twin of me.
